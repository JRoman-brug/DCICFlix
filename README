# DCICFlix Microservices

This repository contains several small microservices for the DCICFlix project. The file below lists each microservice, an author field (auto-detected where possible), and a place to document known endpoints/routes.

If your services are implemented in code, re-run the route discovery step (or ask me to scan again) after adding server files (e.g., `app.py`, `main.py`, `server.js`, `routes.js`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`).

## How to update this README automatically

1. Add your service implementation files into the matching folder (e.g., `Movies/` → `app.py`, `server.js`, or `routes.py`).
2. Ask me to "scan for endpoints" and I will search the repo for route definitions and update this README with discovered HTTP methods and paths.

If you want, I can also add a small script to attempt automatic extraction of endpoints from common frameworks (Express, Flask, FastAPI, Spring Boot). Tell me which language/framework you use and I will scaffold the scanner and run it.
